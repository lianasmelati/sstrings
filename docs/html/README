Creating html documentation
---------------------------

1. This file is only present in the repository sources!

2. The html documentation must be written in "Valid XHTML 1.0 Strict"
   If you don't know how to create such XHTML code, first read
   	
	http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1

   and if you still don't know how to make it, then don't write html code :)
