.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBss_string_enable_gc\fR enables the usage of the garbage collector. You don't need to free memory anymore.

\fBNOTE\fR: this is an experimental gargabe collector and should be used at your own risk. Do not use this function if
your program has already executed a ss_string function. Use it at the top of every program. 

You may use \fBss_string_free\fR(3) and \fBss_string_gc_free\fR(3) if the garbage collector is enabled.

Your programs will use more memory when you use \fBss_string_enable_gc\fR
.SS "Returning value"
\fBss_string_enable_gc\fR returns 0 if the garbage collector cannot be initialized, 1 otherwise.

.SH "BUGS"
