.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The  routine  \fBperror\fR  produces  a message on the standard error output, describing the last error encountered during a call to a
system or library function.  First (if \fImsg\fR is not NULL and \fI*msg\fR is not a null byte ('\\0')) the argument string s is printed,  followed
by a colon and a blank.  Then the message and a new-line.

To be of most use, the argument string should include the name of the function that incurred the error.  The error number is taken
from the external variable \fIss_errno\fR, which is set when errors occur but not cleared when non-erroneous calls are made.
