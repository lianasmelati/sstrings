For Version >= 2.0.1

  - Think about ss_string_append(string, string); what will happen if string->str is changed?
  
  - Ignore the new version 1.0.5 --> deprecated

  - Prepare the new version 2.0.1. Create a new datatype ss_string and write functions for this.
    Most useful ANSI C Function for char* must be implemented for ss_tring. New functions will be implemented 
    as well.
    
  - Create a html documentation
  
  - try to add a structure and functions like C++ std::map<ss_string*, void*>

For Version >= 0.0.2
  - change strsstr [BUG] [done v.0.0.2]
  - change manual pages [BUG] [done v.0.0.2]
